For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'L B2 U3' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 red squares in the down face after completing the move sequence?", "options": ["0", "2", "1", "3"], "answer": "2", "solution": {"moves": "L B2 U3", "query_face": "down", "query_colour": "red", "start_position": {"left": [["grey", "blue", "grey"], ["blue", "blue", "green"], ["orange", "yellow", "red"]], "right": [["orange", "orange", "blue"], ["orange", "orange", "orange"], ["red", "yellow", "blue"]], "down": [["yellow", "green", "yellow"], ["grey", "green", "red"], ["yellow", "blue", "green"]], "up": [["orange", "blue", "grey"], ["grey", "yellow", "green"], ["blue", "orange", "red"]], "back": [["yellow", "red", "green"], ["grey", "grey", "yellow"], ["red", "green", "grey"]], "front": [["green", "red", "green"], ["red", "red", "yellow"], ["blue", "grey", "orange"]]}, "end_position": {"left": [["yellow", "green", "red"], ["orange", "blue", "blue"], ["blue", "green", "grey"]], "right": [["orange", "red", "green"], ["orange", "orange", "yellow"], ["red", "yellow", "orange"]], "down": [["green", "green", "yellow"], ["red", "green", "red"], ["grey", "blue", "grey"]], "up": [["blue", "green", "red"], ["blue", "yellow", "orange"], ["green", "yellow", "green"]], "back": [["orange", "orange", "red"], ["grey", "grey", "grey"], ["yellow", "red", "yellow"]], "front": [["blue", "blue", "grey"], ["grey", "red", "yellow"], ["blue", "grey", "orange"]]}}}
