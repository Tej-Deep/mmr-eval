{"image": "images/number_slide/number_slide_0036.jpg", "question": "The board shown in the image is a sliding puzzle of 4 * 4 tile dimensions. It has 15 numbered tiles and one unoccupied (open) position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively.

{"image": "images/number_slide/number_slide_0070.jpg", "question": "The board shown in the image is a sliding puzzle of 4 * 4 tile dimensions. It has 15 numbered tiles and one unoccupied (open) position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. All tiles always stay and move inside the red boundary wall, as shown in the image. A move is defined as moving the open position by one tile unit in any available direction. You start from the board position shown in the image and perform exactly 3 moves.

{"image": "images/number_slide/number_slide_0086.jpg", "question": "The board shown in the image is a sliding puzzle of 4 * 4 tile dimensions. It has 15 numbered tiles and one unoccupied (open) position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. All tiles always stay and move inside the red boundary wall, as shown in the image. A move is defined as moving the open position by one tile unit in any available direction. You start from the board position shown in the image and perform exactly 4 moves such that the open position is seen moving in the following sequence: left, down, left, right.

What is the maximum sum that you can achieve across the bottom most row in the final board position?", "options": ["30", "1", "29", "46"], "answer": "30", "solution": {"starting_grid": [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 7, 5], [4, 2, 0, 15]], "total_moves": 2, "path_track": {"left, left": [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 7, 5], [0, 4, 2, 15]], "left, right": [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 7, 5], [4, 2, 0, 15]], "left, up": [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 0, 7, 5], [4, 9, 2, 15]], "right, left": [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 7, 5], [4, 2, 0, 15]], "right, up": [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 7, 0], [4, 2, 15, 5]], "up, left": [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 0, 9, 5], [4, 2, 7, 15]], "up, right": [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 5, 0], [4, 2, 7, 15]], "up, up": [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 0, 14], [12, 9, 13, 5], [4, 2, 7, 15]], "up, down": [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 7, 5], [4, 2, 0, 15]]}, "possible_states": [[[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 7, 5], [0, 4, 2, 15]], [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 7, 5], [4, 2, 0, 15]], [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 0, 7, 5], [4, 9, 2, 15]], [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 7, 5], [4, 2, 0, 15]], [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 7, 0], [4, 2, 15, 5]], [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 0, 9, 5], [4, 2, 7, 15]], [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 5, 0], [4, 2, 7, 15]], [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 0, 14], [12, 9, 13, 5], [4, 2, 7, 15]], [[10, 1, 3, 11], [8, 6, 13, 14], [12, 9, 7, 5], [4, 2, 0, 15]]], "unique_positions": 7}}
