Then, construct a step-by-step logical pathway that explicitly shows how each visual observation leads to your solution, explaining why each detail matters and citing specific image evidence at every step. Your analysis will be evaluated by a teacher on two criteria: ***Visual Elements*** (accuracy of perception, spatial understanding, and object recognition) and ***Reasoning*** (logical consistency, valid deductive steps, and sound analytical conclusions). Multiple solution pathways will be explored in parallel at each step, building upon previous reasoning to generate diverse approaches, with the teacher scoring each path to accept or reject based on visual accuracy and logical validity.
